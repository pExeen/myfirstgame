This is my first game. For the moment it is a Labyrint. :)

First you need Love2D to play the games :

On Ubuntu download the .deb file and install it.

On Windows download the installer and install the programm.

On Mac download the app and put it in the Application floder.

______________________________________________________________________

On Linux run the game with :

	love /PathToTheFolder/GameFolder

On Mac run the game this :
	
	/Applications/love.app/Contents/MacOS/love /PathToTheFolder/GameFolder

On Windows :

"C:\Program Files\LOVE\love.exe" "C:\PathToTheFolder\GameFolder"

_______________________________________________________________________

To make a .love file on Mac or on Linux enter this command when you are in the gme folder :
	 
	 zip -9 -r Game.love .

On Windows go in the folder with explored create a zip with all the files and rename the extention to .love

(Optional for Mac users)

Execute :

	nano ~/.bash_profile

and copy this : 

# alias to love
alias love="/Applications/love.app/Contents/MacOS/love"

Now you can run the game with :

	love "~/path/to/mygame"

I hope you will have fun with the game :)
